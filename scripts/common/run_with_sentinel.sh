# run_with_sentinel.sh — run a command whose completion is an ARTIFACT, not an exit code.
#
# GPU-sim trainers routinely finish their real work — checkpoint written, output
# flushed — and then hang forever in simulator teardown. Waiting for a natural
# exit deadlocks the caller; killing on a timer throws away finished work. The
# only reliable completion signal is the sentinel the job itself produces.
#
# So: launch, poll for the sentinel, and once it appears give the process a short
# grace period to exit on its own before taking it down. A process killed AFTER
# its sentinel is a SUCCESS.
#
# Usage:
#   run_with_sentinel.sh --cmd "<shell command>"
#                        [--sentinel-file <path>]     # exists  => done
#                        [--sentinel-log  <substr>]   # in log  => done
#                        [--log <file>] [--poll 15] [--grace 60]
#                        [--kill-after 30] [--timeout 0]
#
# At least one of --sentinel-file / --sentinel-log is required; if both are given,
# EITHER firing counts as done.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  sentinel observed (success, whether or not the process exited on its own)
#   1  process exited and no sentinel ever appeared (real failure)
#   2  usage error
#   3  --timeout elapsed with no sentinel (treated as a failure by callers)
